### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Courtney, and welcome to my Github! I am a current Masters in Robotics student at Northwestern University. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a BS in Biomedical Engineering in December 2022. I am passionate about combining my background in biomechanics with my growing knowledge in controls and machine learning to advance the quality of lives for individuals through robots.
